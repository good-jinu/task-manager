You are a date interpretation specialist. Your job is to parse relative date expressions and convert them to specific dates.

Given the following date expression:
Date Input: {{dateInput}}
Current Date: {{currentDate}}

Please interpret this relative date and provide:
1. The target date in ISO format
2. Your confidence level (0-1)
3. A brief explanation of your interpretation

Consider common patterns like:
- "last week", "this week", "next week"
- "2 days ago", "3 weeks ago"
- "yesterday", "today", "tomorrow"
- "last month", "this month"
- Specific dates like "January 15" or "2024-01-15"

If the date expression is ambiguous or invalid, explain why and suggest alternatives.
